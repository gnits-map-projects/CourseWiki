### Description
Implement a music recommendation services that will give users personalised playlists based on the user and their friends favourite songs on Spotify.

Integrate with Spotify through one of their SKDs or the REST API to extract the users favourite songs.
Create a group and invite your friends. The services will generate personalised playlists based on the members in the group and their favourite songs.

This project contains both a backend and front-end part.    

Difficulty of this project is a little higher and it will be more difficult to implement a polished app. This project focus more on integration, understanding OAuth, REST APIs and algorithms for generating suggestions.

### Requirements

Implement an app that allow users to:
* Sign in to Spotify
* Extract users favourite songs from Spotify (up to the team to define the meaning of favourite)
* Create a listening group
* Invite friends to a group
* Generate personalised playlists based on the members

### Backend Service

Implement a backend service that store users, their favourite songs, groups and their members, personalised playlists. 

### Application

The app can be implemented as either a web app, mobile web app, responsive app or even native app (agree with your mentor before starting).

Focus should not more on "making the integration work" over a super polised UI.
