### Description

Register crimes and offences committed an area.
Use various clustering approaches of data mining to analyse the crime data to find patterns and trends.

This project contains both a backend and front-end part.

### Requirements

Implement an app that allow the investigator to:
* Register a new crime (with all necessary attributes)
* Search for crimes
* View crimes in a list view
* View crimes on a map

Use K-Means clustering to cluster crime activities based on some attributes
* Experiment with different number if cluster
* Find the optimal number of clusters
* Visualise clusters in graph and on the map 

A crime should have the following attributes
* Year
* Crime type
* Gender
* Age
* City
* Population
* Time of day
* Lat & Lon
* More

KNN method classifies new objects based on the similarity measure. It can be used for criminal identification by considering the past crimes and discovering similar crimes that match the current crime based on number of nearest neighbors matched

### Backend Service

Implement a backend service that stores crime data.

Capture and enter at least 30 crimes as example data and PoC. 

To obtain a larger data set for data mining, data can be extracted from a publicly available database, e.g. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) of India. 

### Application

The app can be implemented as either a web app, mobile web app, responsive app or even native app (agree with your mentor before starting).

### Questions

TBD

### Improvement suggestions

Possible improvements and bonus tasks
* Use K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classification for crime prediction
