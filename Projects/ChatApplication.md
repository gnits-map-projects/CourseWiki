### Description

Implement a spatial aware chat application

This project contains both a backend and front-end part.

### Requirements

Implement and app that allow users to:
* Write message in chat room
* Read messages
* Share location
* View shared location on map

Chat room management
* Create chat room
* List available chat rooms
* Search for chat room
* Join chat room
* Leave chat room
* Spatial aware chat room, only see messages from users nearby (or in and around a special location, e.g. city)
* Users must authenticate before they can start chatting.

Basic user administration
* Signup
* Sign in
* Sign out
* Update profile

### Backend Service

Implement a backend service that manages users, chatrooms and messages.

The team can investigate the possibility of using an SaaS as backend, e.g. Firebase. If we go down this route, more time can be spent on implementing additional client features.

### Application

The app can be implemented as either a web app, mobile web app, responsive app or native app (agree with your mentor before starting).

### Questions

Questions to consider before and during the project.
* What functionality will this typical user like to have?
* How do you solve sending and receiving messages at the same time?
* How do you receive new messages without manually refreshing the chat room?

### Improvement suggestions

Possible improvements and bonus tasks
* Set status - offline, available, do not disturb
* Support profil picture
* Write message directly to a person
* Share picture
* View shared pictures
* Like (thumbs up) a message
* Report user for inappropriate behaviour
* Ban user
* Send email to a person that if offline and receives a chat message 
* Spport more then one type of chat client, e.g. web + mobile/desktop app, web + command line (will require more work)
