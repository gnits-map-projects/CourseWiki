### Description

Implement a What To Do on Weekends app. Users can create attractions (places of interest) for other users to discover and experience, e.g. historical sites, tempels, museums, landmarks, parks, outdoor activities etc. Allow users to contribute with user generated content like ratings, comments and pictures to create a fresh and vibrant site.

This project contains both a backend and front-end part.

### Improvement suggestions

* Top attractions by area or in each category
* Support Moderators/trusted users what can do some lever of moderation, e.g. remove bad comments and pictures
* Personalised comments - sort comments in an order relevant to the current use. E.g. users with family might find comments from user users with family more relevant
